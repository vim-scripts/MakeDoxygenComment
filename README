Generates a doxygen comment skeleton for a C, C++,  or Java function, including @brief, @param (for each named argument), and @return.  The tag text as well as a comment block header and footer are configurable.  (Consequently, you can have \brief, etc. if you wish, with little effort.)

It's definitely a little rough around the edges, but I hope you find it useful.

To use:  In vim with the cursor on the line of the function header that contains the parameters (if any), execute the command :Dox.  This will generate the skeleton and leave the cursor after the @brief tag.

Limitations:
Assumes that the function has a blank line above it and that all of the parameters are on the same line.  
Not able to update a comment block after it's been written.
Writes the @return tag for a void function.

Example:
Given:
int foo(char mychar, int yourint, double myarray[])
{ //...
}

Issuing the :Dox command with the cursor on the function declaration would generate

/**
 * @brief
 * 
 * @param mychar
 * @param myint
 * @param myarray
 *
 * @returns
 **/
